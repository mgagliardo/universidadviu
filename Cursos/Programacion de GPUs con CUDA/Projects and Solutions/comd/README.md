## CoMD

Classical molecular dynamics proxy application.

Building this project is more difficult than the other demo projects,
as it started as real-world code. See the readmes in `src-mpi`.

## This is CoMD version 1.1

CoMD is a reference implementation of typical classical molecular
dynamics algorithms and workloads.  It is created and maintained by
The Exascale Co-Design Center for Materials in Extreme Environments
(ExMatEx).  http://codesign.lanl.gov/projects/exmatex.  The
code is intended to serve as a vehicle for co-design by allowing
others to extend and/or reimplement it as needed to test performance of 
new architectures, programming models, etc.
