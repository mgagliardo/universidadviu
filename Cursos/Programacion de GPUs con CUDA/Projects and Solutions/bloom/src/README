//      I. PBF program           //
///////////////////////////////////

This program implements the probabilistic bloom filter algorithm using different methods. It includes a random sequence generator to create input files consisting of a specified probability density function. The distributions supported are: uniform, normal, poisson, and random. Implementation versions consist of a CPU (baseline) version, a parallel CPU (OpenMP) version, a GPU (baseline) version, and an improved GPU version. 

Note: during the creation of this software, several issues came up with running GPU versions successfully always. We provided several scripts to attempt to run the programs. We will continue working on these issues after the course terminates since we found that other methods should provide additional efficiency.
